A web based clone of Photo Roulette.

Uses Typescript + SolidJS on the frontend.

## Why I will probably never finish this project

I was working on this during the conclusion of the school year.

On the last day of school I was injured during an accident at a party.

I sustained an injury to my face which sent me to the hospital.

As a result, I was not able to complete this project in the time I had given, and will have to make room for newer things.
